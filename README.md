## Challenges Faced and How it was overcome
| Challenge Faced | Method to overcome |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| Implementing 2-D array with double pointer, and accessing it | Implemented with a 2-D array declaration |
| Writing test cases with manual functions | Kept the function constant and predefined | 
| Taking manual functions | Proved to be very complex in terms of reading the user input, didn't implement |
| Functions being redifined while using for testing | Declared the function in header file and Defined in respective files |
| Using the extern keyword to extend the visibility of a pointer for the entire program | Ongoing |
